/*
 Write a function that takes in two Strings (‘note’ and ‘magazine’). Return true if the note
could have been cut out from the magazine. Example 1) note = “ceba”; magazine = “abcde”
returns true (the magazine has ≥ 1 ‘e’, ≥ 1 ‘c’, ≥ 1 ‘b’, ≥ 1 ‘a’ so the note could have been
made by cutting characters out of the magazine); example 2) note = “deaa”, magazine =
“abcde” returns false (the note has more ‘a’ characters than can be cut out of the
magazine); example 3) note = “aacc”, magazine = “bbccaa” returns true.
